# Compressed to Code

Design a system that takes compressed code snippets, which have been reduced to concise function names and pseudocode-like summaries, and converts them into syntactically correct code in the specified programming language. The input will consist of function names, their parameters, and pseudocode-like summaries of their logic.

The system should support multiple programming languages, including but not limited to Python, JavaScript, C#, Ruby, and Java. It should be able to generate well-structured code with appropriate syntax based on the provided function names, parameters, and logic summaries.

You can assume that the input will always provide the following details for each function:
- Function name (e.g., `GetRotationInput`)
- Parameter(s) (e.g., `inputAmount`)
- Pseudocode-like summary of the function's logic

Example input:
```
Function name: GetRotationInput
Parameters: None
Logic summary: Retrieve input from horizontal axis

Function name: CalcAccelRotateWithinAngle
Parameters: inputAmount
Logic summary: Calculate acceleration for rotation within angle mode

Function name: CalcAccelInputThreshold
Parameters: inputAmount
Logic summary: Calculate acceleration for input threshold mode

Function name: CalcAccelInputAmountRelative
Parameters: inputAmount
Logic summary: Calculate acceleration for input amount relative mode
```

Given the input, the system should produce the corresponding syntactically correct code for the specified programming language. Make sure to handle formatting, variable declarations, function definitions, and logic implementation as needed.
